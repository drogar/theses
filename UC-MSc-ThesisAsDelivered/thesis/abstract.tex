This  thesis presents the semantics of \emph{quantum stacks} and 
 a functional quantum programming language, \lqpl{}. 
An operational semantics for \lqpl{} based on quantum
stacks in the form of a term logic is developed and used
as an interpretation of quantum circuits.  The operational
semantics is then extended to handle recursion and algebraic datatypes.
Recursion and datatypes are not concepts  found in quantum 
circuits, but both  are generally required for 
modern programming languages.

The language \lqpl{}  is introduced in a 
discussion and example format. Various example programs using both
classical and 
quantum algorithms are used to illustrate features of the language. 
Details of the language,
including handling of \qbits, general data types and classical data
are covered. 

The quantum stack machine is then presented. 
Supporting data for operation of the  machine are introduced
and the transitions induced by the machine's instructions are given.

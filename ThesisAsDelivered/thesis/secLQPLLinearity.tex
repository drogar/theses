\section{Linearity of \lqpl}\label{sec:lqpllinearity}
The language \lqpl{} treats all quantum variables as \emph{linear}. This 
means that any variable \emph{may only be used once}. 

\subsection{Linearity of quantum variables}\label{subsec:linearityofqvs}
Our primary reason for implementing this is the underlying aspect of 
linearity of quantum systems, as in the \emph{no-duplication} rule, 
which must be respected at all times. This allows us to provide
compile-time checking that enforces this rule.

The compiler and language do
 provide ways to ``ease the burden'' of linear thinking. 
For example, function calls provide a specialized syntax for variables
which are both input and output to a function.

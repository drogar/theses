Anyone who has written a thesis knows that an incredible number of people 
support and inspire the writer. I have been incredibly fortunate to have
many gifted people in my life during this period. 

My greatest appreciation to Dr. Robin Cockett for working with me
these past years. His tireless efforts and indefatigable enthusiasm
are a constant source of inspiration.

Thanks to Robin Cockett, Peter Hoyer and Barry Sanders for serving 
on my thesis committee.

Thank you to Peter Selinger for support and encouragement during the 
initial development and experimentation with quantum programming languages.


Thank you to my many proof-readers from the
programming languages lab, Xiuzhan Guo, Ning Tang, Sean Nichols
and Pieter Hofstra . Any remaining errors are mine.


The author would like to acknowledge Bryan Eastin and Steven T. Flammia, 
the developers of the 
 Qcircuit  package  used 
to draw the circuits presented in this thesis and  M. Tatsuya, who developed
the proof package used in the judgements.

Finally, a wonderful thanks to my sweetheart Marie, who supported me,
inspired me and proofread the thesis. C'est pour toi que je suis.

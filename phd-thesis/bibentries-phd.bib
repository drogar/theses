       can be expressed as compositions of these gates. We
       investigate the number of the above gates required to
       implement other gates, such as generalized
       Deutsch-Toffoli gates, that apply a specific U(2)
       transformation to one input bit if and only if the
       logical AND of all remaining input bits is satisfied.
       These gates play a central role in many proposed
       constructions of quantum computational networks. We
       derive upper and lower bounds on the exact number of
       elementary gates required to build up a variety of two-
       and three-bit quantum gates, the asymptotic number
       required for n-bit Deutsch-Toffoli gates, and make some

@inproceedings{Alimarine05:arrows,
  Abstract = {Invertible programming occurs in the area of data conversion where it is required that the conversion in one direction is the inverse of the other. For that purpose, we introduce bidirectional arrows (bi-arrows). The bi-arrow class is an extension of Haskell's arrow class with an extra combinator that changes the direction of computation.The advantage of the use of bi-arrows for invertible programming is the preservation of invertibility properties using the bi-arrow combinators. Programming with bi-arrows in a polytypic or generic way exploits this the most. Besides bidirectional polytypic examples, including invertible serialization, we give the definition of a monadic bi-arrow transformer, which we use to construct a bidirectional parser/pretty printer.},
